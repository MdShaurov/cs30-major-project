# CS30 Major Project Proposal - Md Shaurov
I am planning to make a simplified version of a game called ShellShock. The game creates a random 2D terrain map
every time you click play. Where there are 2 tanks on either side of the 2D map. It is turn based so only one player
aims the gun of the tank by adjusting the arc of the barrel. The player can shoot and if the other player's tank is 
not destroyed yet, it becomes the other players turn. 

Need to Have List:
- random terrain generation
- ability to move, aim, and shoot
- draw 2 tanks on either sides
- bullet physics

Nice to Have List:
- ability to shoot different types of shells
- animated visuals
