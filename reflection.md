# Reflection - Md Shaurov

# Advice to self if doing this again:

- Make a habit to work on the project for a relatively short while regularly and keep consistancy. 
- Look all the resources that are available to me including the p5js libraries.

# Hardest part of Project:

Figuring out the mechanics behind bullet drop off, tank movement according to terrain, and the time system. 

# Did you complete the Needs to Have List:

Yes:
✓ random terrain generation
✓ ability to move, aim, and shoot
✓ draw 2 tanks on either sides
✓ bullet & tank physics
✓ sound effects

# What are you most proud of:

I am proud to have developed a working and observable physical mechanics over moving accross randomly generated terrain.
